### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

With more than a decade of experience as a front-end developer, I specialize in crafting user interfaces that seamlessly blend aesthetics with functionality. Currently, I collaborate with small and medium-sized businesses as well as public organizations to design bespoke web solutions, with a strong emphasis on user experience and technical performance.

My deep passion for CSS, dedication to web standards and accessibility, and commitment to environmental sustainability are evident in every project I take on, as I strive towards a more accessible and responsible digital transformation.

- ðŸŽ“ I recently completed a diploma course in React on OpenClassrooms ðŸŽ‰, where I significantly advanced my skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, and algorithms ðŸš€. This training helped me level up my expertise and refine my abilities in these key areas.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m looking to join a company and a team that values an accessible and responsible digital transition, where I can contribute my skills and experience. Iâ€™m eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals who share these values, and I am excited about the opportunity to learn, grow, and make a positive impact together.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about creating accessible and high-performance user interfaces, optimizing web or how to implement web standards and best practices in your projects. I'm also passionate about discussing digital sustainability and responsible tech practices!
- ðŸ“š Iâ€™m an enthusiastic learner who loves sharing what I discover with others. Whether itâ€™s the latest tech tips or new ways to tackle challenges, Iâ€™m always excited to connect, collaborate, and learn together!
