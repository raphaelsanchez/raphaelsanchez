### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Trained designer with solid experience in interface development, I know how to be an effective link between these two worlds and facilitate exchanges. Senior in frontend development, I am currently training on the React library on which I still consider myself a junior.

Worried about environmental issues, the place and impact of digital technology in our world, concerned with respecting standards and web accessibility, I now seek to give meaning to my work.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and improve my javascript skills on OpenClassrooms
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with persons aware of the need to begin an accessible and responsible digital transition.
